This thesis focuses on low-cost applications of computer-vision in
agriculture which provide additional precision and capabilities for crop 
management systems. Technological progress of tractor and 
implement technology has been steady and resulted in significant gains
over the past decade. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness and
accessibility of embedded electronic systems has
dramatically improved. Field operations such as spraying, seeding, and 
tillage are likely to adopt precision and semi-autonomous systems
which utilize cameras and sensors. Hopefully, precision agricultural
systems can improve input efficiency and the degree of control farmers
have over their fields, even at scale. I feel that this topic is a great
environment for applications of machine-learning in the agricultural sector. 
Although this paper will only graze the surface of adaptive control,
it is extremely interesting to me and might provide a good excuse
for a doctorate.

I would like to dedicate this work to both of my grand-dads.
